## PAGE #1

The Annual Animal Activity Tournament is about to begin!

Saabira the Sloth musters up the courage to finally play in the games with other animals.

## PAGE #2

The first activity is a maze and her opponent is a bouncy Ray the rabbit! The rabbit hops through the maze at lightning speed! However, Ray quickly gets lost and forgets where's he's been. Saabira the Sloth is patient and moves slowly, but surely through the maze. She passes a very tired Ray the rabbit and wins! {Features a maze on the page}

## PAGE #3

The next activity is to find a hidden item. Saabira the Sloth is up against Mary the Monkey. The only clue they're given is this riddle: what has legs, but can't walk? Mary the Monkey doesn't bother thinking about the riddle. Instead, she picks up each item one at a time and gives it to the judge. Saabira the Sloth takes time to think about the riddle and realizes the trick! {Features hide and seek puzzle}

## PAGE #4

The next activity is building a tower of blocks. Saabira is up against Sly the Swan. The one with the tallest tower wins. Sly keeps trying to build a tall tower of blocks one on top of the other, but it keeps falling down. Saabira realizes the best way to build a tower is the a strong base. Her tower may not be very tall, but it won't fall down easily. Saabira wins again!

## PAGE #5

The last activity is a race. Saabira the Sloth finds herself up against Tanya the Turtle. The announcer yells "3...2...1...START!" The race begins and both animals are...very...slowwww. Saabira the Sloth and Tanya the Turtle take all day to finish the race. However, along the way Saabira helps Tanya get over rocks and Tanya helps Saabira get over water. By the end, Tanya the Turtle barely wins the race, and Saabira cheers for her new friend.
