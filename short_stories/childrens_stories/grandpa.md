Bob always thought it so odd when adults asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. There were so many things he hasn't tried, yet - how could he possibly know what he'd want to be? His quick answer was to say he wanted to be an astronaut, but he didn't really mean it.

At school one day, Bob was at lunch and they were having pizza. It was his first time eating pizza and he didn't know how to eat it. He looked around and saw other kids picking it up with their hands. Bob didn't like getting his hands messy, but he picked it up anyway to fit it. It was yummy!

When he got home, his parents reminded him to pick an activity for the summer - basketball, tennis, or soccer. He liked sports and picked tennis, thinking he would try it out. After a few weeks, Bob realized he didn't like tennis, but when he told his parents he wanted to try something else they said he had to keep going.

One day, Bob's grandfather came to visit, like he usually does once or twice a year. Bob loved spending time with his grandpa. It always seemed like his grandpa understood him and never made Bob feel bad.

Bob's grandpa asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. Bob felt like he could tell his grandpa the truth and said he didn't know. His grandpa smiled saying, "That's a good answer! You're still young and have plenty of time to figure that out. I didn't know what I wanted to do until I was 32!" Bob felt better knowing he didn't need to have all the answers right now.

Bob's grandpa spent the day with Bob and ended up taking Bob out for lunch at the pizzeria. Bob was excited, since he liked pizza. But when they sat down to begin eating Bob stopped and looked down at his pizza. His grandpa asked, "Aren't you going to eat your pizza?" Bob said, "I like pizza, but I don't like getting my hands dirty." His grandpa laughed and said, "Well then how about using a knife and fork?" Bob never even thought of that. His grandpas went and came back with a knife and fork and showed Bob how to cut it, like a pancake. Bob loved the taste and didn't have to get his hands dirty. Bob's grandpa said, "I think you just discovered something about yourself - you like eating pizza with a knife and fork". Bob smiled at the idea of learning about himself.

When they got home, Bob's parent reminded him he had tennis practice the next day, and Bob started to frown. Concerned, Bob's grandpa asked "Why do you look so down. Don't you like playing tennis?". Bob said, "Not really. After a few weeks of trying it out, I just don't like playing tennis. But mom and dad said I have to keep practicing since they paid for the lessons already." "I see," said his grandpa, "I'll have a talk with them." Bob didn't have to go to tennis anymore and after trying a few more sports, found out he like playing soccer the most!
