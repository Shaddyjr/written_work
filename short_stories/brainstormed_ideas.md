# Brainstormed Ideas

### There are just some "off the cuff" ideas I had. These could serve as proof of concepts for a book!

## The Magic Analyst

Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Mortin the Precise, and I've come to this beautiful city today to unleash your hidden potential!

We in the Analytics Guild are well versed in the intricacies of all types of magic. Elemental, sorcery, incantations, divination, meta magic, and even necromancy - in accordance with ethical standards, of course!

If you or someone you know is magically inclined in any capacity, we can be of service.
We take care of the nitty-gritty, so you don't have to.

Have you ever noticed fires look larger when you're around? Perhaps you're a hot shot and didn't know it. Or maybe you zap what you tap because you're a real life shock jock? Are you smart enough to learn "Brain Drain"?

I happen to specialize in elemental magic. I once worked with a particularly gifted individual with a flare for theatrics - a veritable "rags to riches" that one. Let's call him as Edward. I met Edward when he was only a teenager working as a farmhand. There was nothing noteworthy about him - save for the fact that Edward would light the stable lanterns with sparks from his hands. He heard tales of mages, wizards, sorcerers and warlocks and didn't think much of his seemingly limited potential.

I worked with Edward for 4 weeks, observing him and testing his abilities. By the end of it, I was able to offer him two basic fire spells, one rank A spell, and one rank S spell that had never been seen before or since! If he wanted to, Edward could have torched the whole farm three times over with the wave of his hand! It will suffice to say Edward doesn't work on the farm anymore.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "Is such a thing possible?" or "It probably costs too much!"

I can assure you, we at the Analytics Guild take pride in our work and guarantee satisfaction or else you get your money back.

We're offering 3 services today: a diagnostic, spell discovery, and spell enhancement.

The diagnostic is a 1-hour session with yours truly, where we establish a baseline of what schools of magic an individual is inclined towards. As our most popular option, the diagnostic typically goes for 5 gold, but is being offered today at a significant discount for the low low price of 1 gold piece!

Spell discovery is a process where you will work one-on-one with a magic analyst. You select a magic school within your domain and your specialist will uncover your hidden powers! This option costs 10 gold per week, and the discovered spells are a separate cost based on their rank.

Last, but not least, spell enhancement is a process where your specialist will coach you to have your spells put less of a strain on your body, pack a bigger punch, or change in some unique way. This option has no fixed price as it is entirely customized and dependent on the individual and the specialist.

Thank you all for your time and attention! My name again is Mortin the Precise from the Analytics Guild. Now...who's first?

## The Reason

"Think of it like this...we go to school to learn quickly the things other people took much longer to discover. It is only logical that we do this because time is our enemy. This collection of discoveries is called the "body of knowledge." We were all born at the center of our own nothingness and over time we learn and expand our individual understanding. Hopefully we live long enough to eventually add to the collective progress. But already you see the problem, don't you?"

"It's inevitable. There will come a point when training a human to get them to the edge of our knowledge takes a lifetime. Perhaps all understanding in the universe exists within tiny speck that is human understanding, but I wager that's unlikely."

"Time is the problem. If we all had more time, we could collectively expand that tiny circle of understanding. Hunger, disease, inequality - every problem can be solved. We just need more time. If we solve the problem of time, we solve all problems."

"So, to answer your question...immortality. That's why I'm doing this."

"You're insane," whispered the prisoner.

"Oh, grow up! It's so easy to criticize innovators because we're willing to try what others are too afraid to dare dream about. Have you even been listening!? I'm not doing this for me! I'm doing it for all of us - for the greater good. For all of humanity. Your sacrifice will not be in vain."

## God returns

At 7:45 AM on December 26th 2033, a God-like being manifests themselves as a humanoid apparition. They belong to a species of particle-beings who live on the sub-atomic level witnessing infinitesimal phenomenon, causality, and experience time going both forward and backwards. I know this because I interviewed the apparition after they spontaneously formed themselves in my dinning room while I was eating breakfast. My name is Cassandra Williams and I'm an investigative journalist for the Wyoming Herald.

Homeless person. Drunk interviewer.

The following is the impromptu interview with the being:

you're an alien?

Can you read my thoughts?

# The Doctrine

This Doctrine is inherently incomplete and flawed, yet we must start somewhere.
At the time of this writing, the words herein were written by some of the brightest minds we have to offer, but we recognize we are flawed and biased beings.
As we must strive for a more perfect union we refuse to require perfection at the expense of making progress.
As many of our writers have found, a difficult goal often serves as a catalyst for improvement regardless of whether or not the goal is ever achieved.

As a collective, we've decided the best way to convey meaning is through stories.
Storytelling is an ancient tradition of our people and the Doctrine is built on this old foundation.

As a collective, we've decided the best way to convey meaning is by keeping the Doctrine simple and short.
The majority of people are simple folk and this Doctrine is meant for all.

As a collective, we've decided the best way to convey meaning is to distribute the Doctrine in many languages.
It is our hope these words will resonate throughout our collective histories as they are our stories all.

The reader should be mindful these stories happened in their own time and place and written about later, likely in a different time and place.
As a collective, we want to adhere to the truth. Despite our best efforts, we have failed to do so. Understanding is paramount - the details are secondary.

The reader should be mindful there may be doubt as to whether these stories really happened or not.
As a collective, we believe truth is truth regardless of whether or not it lies in our reality or fiction. Understanding is paramount - how understanding is achieved is secondary.

The reader should be mindful these words were written by flawed men. Only the Fool would blindly follow what they read in a book - the Doctrine is no exception.
As a collective, we have many lessons to offer from our combined experience. However, this should not be confused with divinity. Our lessons were hard earned though many failings, but ultimately it is You who must combine Your own experiences to make any sense of it. Understanding is paramount - what is written in the Doctrine is secondary.
