# Brainstormed Ideas

### There are just some "off the cuff" ideas I had. These could serve as proof of concepts for a book!

## The Magic Analyst

Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Mortin the Precise, and I've come to this beautiful city today to unleash your hidden potential!

We in the Analytics Guild are well versed in the intricacies of all types of magic. Elemental, sorcery, incantations, divination, meta magic, and even necromancy - in accordance with ethical standards, of course!

If you or someone you know is magically inclined in any capacity, we can be of service.
We take care of the nitty-gritty, so you don't have to.

Have you ever noticed fires look larger when you're around? Perhaps you're a hot shot and didn't know it. Or maybe your taps zap because you're a shock jock? Do you think you have the know-how to learn "Brain Drain"?

I happen to specialize in elemental magic. For the uninitiated, that's magic focused on water, fire, and the like. I once worked with a particularly gifted individual with a flare for theatrics - a veritable "rags to riches" that one. For confidentiality, I won't mention his real name, but I'll refer to him as Edward. I met Edward when he was only a teenager working as a farmhand. There was nothing noteworthy about him - save for the fact that Edward would light the stable lanterns with sparks from his hands. He heard tales of mages, wizards, sorcerers and warlocks and didn't think much of his seemingly limited potential.

I worked with Edward for 4 weeks, observing him and testing his abilities. By the end of it, I was able to offer him two basic fire spells, one rank A spell, and one rank S spell that had never been seen before or since! If he wanted to, Edward could have torched the whole farm three times over with the wave of his hand! It will suffice to say Edward doesn't work on the farm anymore.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "Is such a thing possible?" or "It probably costs too much!"

I can assure you, we at the Analytics Guild take pride in our work and guarantee satisfaction or else you get your gold back.

We're offering 3 services today: a diagnostic, spell discovery, and spell enhancement.

The diagnostic is a 1-hour session with yours truly, where we establish a baseline of what schools of magic an individual is inclined towards. As our most popular option, the diagnostic typically goes for 5 gold, but is being offered today at a significant discount for the low low price of 1 gold!

Spell discovery is a process where you will work one-on-one with a magic analyst. You select a magic school within your domain and your specialist will uncover your hidden powers! This option costs 10 gold per week, and the discovered spells are a separate cost based on their rank.

Last, but not least, spell enhancement is a process where your specialist will coach you to have your spells put less of a strain on your body, pack a bigger punch, or change in some unique way. This option has no fixed price as it is entirely customized and dependent on the individual and the specialist.

Thank you all for your time and attention! My name again is Mortin the Precise from the Analytics Guild. Now...who's first?
