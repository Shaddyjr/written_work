1. "I wish I had paid more attention when..."
   - the mailman rang my door with a package in hand. I don't remember ordering anything. Doing me a favor, the mailman wrenched me out of my stupor with a gentle "Thank goodness it's Friday, huh?". "Uhh, yeah. Sure," I half-responded. Was it Friday already? I quickly sign for the package and the man is thankfully gone as quickly as he arrived.
   - Taking the package inside, I set it on the living room table to evaluate it. It had my name on it. Was it a gift? My birthday was two months ago, so it shouldn't be for that. Besides, my friends wouldn't bother with sending gifts - not right now anyway. The Pandemic has turned us all into shut-ins. Not that I'm complaining. I've been loving the quiet and solitude. In fact, the only thing I got for my birthday was a slew of well wishes on Facebook. In truth, I had forgotten it was my birthday until I got the notifications.
   - It must be a trick! Some YouTuber or Ticky Tocker is having a go at me. I should just throw it away! Why do people insist on entangling me in their lives!? I won't be exploited for a few clicks and views on whatever flash-in-the-pan platform is trending right now.
   - Shaking the box reveals little. There's something bouncing around in there, but what?
   - I take a deep breathe ready to embarrass myself and open it...
   - Ah, of course! The Crocs I ordered last week. I breath a sigh of relief.
   - Back to the show I was watching before being rudely interrupted.
2. "'How did you know?' I asked, not sure I wanted the answer. I thought I had been careful. I thought she..."
3. "It flashed through the sky and then it was gone. Lucy was sure she had seen an UFO and was equally sure aliens were here to secretly make contact with a human being. Maybe they would choose her. Maybe she would get to visit their ship. Maybe..."
