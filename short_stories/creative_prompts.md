1. "I wish I had paid more attention when..."
   - the mailman rang my door with a package in hand. I don't remember ordering anything. Doing me a favor, the mailman wrenched me out of my stupor with a gentle "Thank goodness it's Friday, huh?". "Uhh, yeah. Sure," I half-responded. Was it Friday already? I quickly sign for the package and the man is thankfully gone as quickly as he arrived.
   - Taking the package inside, I set it on the living room table to evaluate it. It had my name on it. Was it a gift? My birthday was two months ago, so it shouldn't be for that. Besides, my friends wouldn't bother with sending gifts - not right now anyway. The Pandemic has turned us all into shut-ins. Not that I'm complaining. I've been loving the quiet and solitude. In fact, the only thing I got for my birthday was a slew of well wishes on Facebook. In truth, I had forgotten it was my birthday until I got the notifications.
   - It must be a trick! Some YouTuber or Ticky Tocker is having a go at me. I should just throw it away! Why do people insist on entangling me in their lives!? I won't be exploited for a few clicks and views on whatever flash-in-the-pan platform is trending right now.
   - Shaking the box reveals little. There's something bouncing around in there, but what?
   - I take a deep breathe ready to embarrass myself and open it...
   - Ah, of course! The Crocs I ordered last week. I breath a sigh of relief.
   - Back to the show I was watching before being rudely interrupted.
2. "'How did you know?' I asked, not sure I wanted the answer. I thought I had been careful. I thought she..."
   - wasn't as cunning as she let on. Perhaps her lateness had something to do with it. While she was distracted with a response, I leap at her at full speed. I decapitate her with a single slice of my taut hand at her throat. Well...almost. Some sinew keeps her head attached to her neck like a PEZ dispenser. I sigh at my sloppiness.
   - "I'm so sorry, Sonia; you're reaction time is as quick as ever." She tries to respond, but gurgles blood and spit. Her voice box is decimated, but it seems Sonia will be with us a little longer.
   - I look away..not disgusted by the sight, but being forced to end her. "For seventy-three years I taught you...molded you into my successor. For seventy-three years I cleaned up your messes and protected you. Seventy-three years down the drain."
   - I look over at my table. Tonight's meal is laying there, still unconscious from the chloroform.
   - I sigh again. "You left bodies all over the country like confetti at a parade. Any hunter with half a brain cell could tell what was going on. You implicated yourself...and therefore me." As I look over, Sophia's eyes close. "I didn't kill you, young one...your hubris did."
   - Just then, dinner wakes up. His eyes dart frantically across the room as tears pour down his face. I despise the taste of cortisol.
3. "It flashed through the sky and then it was gone. Lucy was sure she had seen an UFO and was equally sure aliens were here to secretly make contact with a human being. Maybe they would choose her. Maybe she would get to visit their ship. Maybe..."
