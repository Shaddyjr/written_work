1. "I wish I had paid more attention when..."
   - the mailman rang my door with a package in hand. I don't remember ordering anything. Doing me a favor, the mailman wrenched me out of my stupor with a gentle "Thank goodness it's Friday, huh?". "Uhh, yeah. Sure," I half-responded. Was it Friday already? I quickly sign for the package and the man is thankfully gone as quickly as he arrived.
   - Taking the package inside, I set it on the living room table to evaluate it. It had my name on it. Was it a gift? My birthday was two months ago, so it shouldn't be for that. Besides, my friends wouldn't bother with sending gifts - not right now anyway. The Pandemic has turned us all into shut-ins. Not that I'm complaining. I've been loving the quiet and solitude. In fact, the only thing I got for my birthday was a slew of well wishes on Facebook. In truth, I had forgotten it was my birthday until I got the notifications.
   - It must be a trick! Some YouTuber or TicTocker is having a go at me. I should just throw it away! Why do people insist on entangling me in their lives!? I won't be exploited for a few clicks and views on whatever flash-in-the-pan platform is trending right now.
   - Shaking the box reveals little. There's something bouncing around in there, but what?
   - I take a deep breathe ready to embarrass myself and open it...
   - Ah, of course! The Crocs I ordered last week. I breath a sigh of relief.
   - Back to the show I was watching before being rudely interrupted.
2. "'How did you know?' I asked, not sure I wanted the answer. I thought I had been careful. I thought she..."
   - wasn't as cunning as she let on. Perhaps her lateness had something to do with it. While she was distracted with a response, I leap at her at full speed. I decapitate her with a single slice of my taut hand at her throat. Well...almost. Some sinew keeps her head attached to her neck like a PEZ dispenser. I sigh at my sloppiness.
   - "I'm so sorry, Sonia; you're reaction time is as quick as ever." She tries to respond, but gurgles blood and spit. Her voice box is decimated. It seems my apprentice will be with us a little longer.
   - I look away...not disgusted by the sight, but instead by the necessity to end her. "For seventy-three years I taught you...molded you into my successor. I cleaned up your messes, protected you, and for what? Seventy-three years down the drain."
   - I look over at my table. Tonight's meal is laying there, still unconscious from the chloroform.
   - I sigh again. "You left bodies...evidence all over the city like breadcrumbs for the hunters. Any hunter with half a brain could tell what was going on. You implicated yourself...and therefore me." As I look over, Sophia's eyes close. I close my eyes, too, and whisper "I didn't kill you, young one...your hubris did."
   - Just then, dinner wakes up. His eyes dart frantically across the room. He begins to reek of fear as tears pour down his face. I despise the taste of cortisol.
3. "It flashed through the sky and then it was gone. Lucy was sure she had seen an UFO and was equally sure aliens were here to secretly make contact with a human being. Maybe they would choose her. Maybe she would get to visit their ship. Maybe..."
4. "The music drifted out of the club like a vibrating pule. I could feel it in my bones. The night was alive with possibility. I could even imagine myself..."
5. "Someone really needs to design a better..."
   - vibrator
   - conversation starter
   - needle
6. "It began as a practical joke. But by the end of the day, nobody was laughing. It seemed innocent enough at first, because Jerry and I have a history of playing practical jokes on one another. He was the one to start the whole thing, if I'm not mistaken. He..."
   - half-truths make some go too far into the belief. So much so that it leads to irreversible action.
   - use words related to bugs and disgust.
   - death of dear animal. maggots. Person causing it keeps it to themselves, curls up into a cacoon.
7. "We took turns guarding the door, neither of us sleeping very much. Ricky looked nervous, and suddenly I felt bad about getting him involved. I shouldn't have..."
   - Door is empty, both duped into thinking loot was stored behind door.
8. "What are you supposed to think when your best friend tells you he's a vampire? At first, of course, I laughed, and thought it was a joke. But I wasn't laughing when Conner..."
   - Not real vampire, but goth wannabe.
9. "Sometimes kids are the only ones willing to say what's really on their minds, and our family needed a little dose of honesty. We almost never said something straight out. My mother was the worst. All she would do was..."
   - daddy is sleeping with mom's best friend. Everyone knows except mom and grandpa (his father) - similar to Big Daddy Pollitt from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ncFrg9afa8. EVERYONE'S LYING! Lies are a system we live in.
10. "I didn't cry when she died, or at the funeral, or at the reception. It wasn't until the next morning when I went into the pantry and saw row upon row of canned vegetables, fruits and jams she had prepared for the long winter ahead. The shelves were filled with..."

- Daughter, very young. Sally. Murdered in the streets.
- beautiful, smart, going places. Making money and married beneath her station.
- Father has military training and this breaks him. Resolves to end things.
- Make reader assume not a person of color and then reveal at end.
