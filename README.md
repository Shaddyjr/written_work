# written_work

I'm exploring the world of writing!  
I'll be working with https://nanowrimo.org/ to complete writing prompts and challenges to learn and practice writing.

I plan to keep track of my work in this repository.

- Git is a great tool for software version control, and I figured it would also be useful for written works, too.

Happy writing and reading!
